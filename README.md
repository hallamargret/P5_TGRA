## About the program

This program was created on a MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2015) with macOS Big Sur version 11.2.3, with a 1,6 GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5 Processor and a MacBook Air (13-inch, Early 2014) with MacOS High Sierra version 10.13.6, with a 1,4 GHz Intel Core i5 processor. The program was written and tested in Visual Studio Code using the terminal and the terminal in VSCode.

The game is a 2 player 3D car racing game. We have 2 cars that are competing against each other to be the first one to drive 2 laps around the track. We have two viewports so both players are driving in first person view.

The game ends when the first player to drive 2 laps drives over the finishing line. Then there will be a victory screen displayed for the players, indicating which player won the race, “P1 WON” if player one (that uses W-A-S-D on the keyboard and that has the top viewport) won the race or “P2 WON” if player two (that uses the arrows on the keyboard and that has the lower viewport) won the race.


## What is needed to install
The computer that the program is run on needs to have python, openGL and pygame installed.


Thank you for your time and enjoy competing with your friends in this racing car game.
